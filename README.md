# Graph_Edge_Connectivity
Course Work from Discrete Mathematics. 
PROBLEM: Find edge connectivity of given graph.

The main() function is in cpp file named vertex_connectivity_of_graph.cpp.
To run the program follow this steps 
    1. In matrix_creation.cpp file, change input files' path.
    2. To enter another graph, change it in input_graph.cpp file.
Output will be in output console.
